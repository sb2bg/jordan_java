# Jordan High School Special Ed Point of Payment and Coffee Delivery System

This project is designed for Jordan High School, specifically for the special education students. It aims to provide a practical and interactive experience by mimicking a point of payment system. Additionally, it also includes a feature for teachers to order coffee deliveries.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine. You can then open the project in your preferred development environment.

### Prerequisites

This project is built with Flutter. Ensure you have Flutter and Dart SDK installed on your machine. You can download Flutter from the official website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

## Usage

To use the coffee delivery system, orders can be populated either automatically using excel files, or manually through the interface. Data required includes their name, their order preferences (creamer, sweetener, special requests), order frequency, and their room number for delivery. Sorting and filtering options are available to help manage the orders. To edit the options available in the coffee delivery system, you can enter the item edit screen using the drawer.

To use the point of payment system, use the drawer on the left to enter the "cashier mode". You will enter the details of the transaction, such as the item and amount purchased. To edit the options available in the point of payment system, you can enter the item edit screen using the drawer.

To change which mode the default screen is, you can select the "Make Default Screen" option in the drawer.
